[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deluan/gomate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deluan/gomate) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/deluan/gomate)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/deluan/gomate) [![Coverage](http://gocover.io/_badge/github.com/deluan/gomate)](http://gocover.io/github.com/deluan/gomate) 

Implementation of [Soulmate](https://github.com/seatgeek/soulmate)'s 
full-text search algorithm in Go, using [LedisDB](ledisdb.com) backend

For an introduction to the algorithm, read [this](http://patshaughnessy.net/2011/11/29/two-ways-of-using-redis-to-build-a-nosql-autocomplete-search-index).

I wrote this lib as a quick search implementation for [GoSonic](https://github.com/deluan/gosonic), 
but I decided to publish it as an independent, reusable library.
